# U-Net-Topology-Optimization
This is the master thesis research by Pei-Hsu Chung.
The traditional topology optimization is shown in simp_topology_optimization.ipynb
The U-Net topology optimization using proxy databases are shown in U-Net Topo 2D.ipynb, U-Net Topo 3D force.ipynb, and U-Net Topo 3D heat.ipynb
The topology optimization calculates using network.py in place of simp iteration is shown in MMTMTONN.ipynb
